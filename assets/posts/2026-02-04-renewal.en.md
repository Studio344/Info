# Site Renewal: Enhancing Usability and Technical Content

I have fully renewed my portfolio site to improve user experience<br>
and share more detailed technical information.<br>
Previously a single-page layout, the site is now multi-page,<br>
allowing for dedicated project details and a blog section.

My goal was to move beyond a simple "link collection"<br>
and create content where I can explain "what technologies were used"<br>
and "key implementation details" for each project.

Key changes include:

- **Project Detail Pages**: Created dedicated pages for projects like UCFitness.
- **Essential Pages**: Added Privacy Policy and Contact pages.
- **Sitemap**: Organized the site structure for better navigation.

I will be updating the development logs irregularly.<br>
Thank you for visiting!
