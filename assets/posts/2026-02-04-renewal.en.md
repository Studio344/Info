# I Renewed My Portfolio Site!

I decided to give my portfolio site a complete makeover to make it more user-friendly and to share more about the tech I love!
Previously, it was just a long single page, but I switched to a multi-page layout so I could create detailed pages for each project and start writing blog posts like this one.

I didn't want it to be just a "list of links." I wanted to create content where you can actually read about "what tech I used" and "what specific details I focused on" for each project.

Here are the key changes:

- **Project Detail Pages**: Created dedicated pages for projects like UCFitness and this Portfolio itself.
- **Essential Pages**: Added a Privacy Policy and Contact page properly.
- **Sitemap**: Cleaned up the site structure.

I'll be updating this irregularly, so please feel free to drop by!
