# Site Renewal for Usability and Technical Showcase

To improve user experience and share more detailed technical information, I revamped the portfolio site structure from a single page to a multi-page layout. The intention is not just a collection of links, but to provide technical details of each project as 'readable content'.

Key changes are as follows:

- Creation of project detail pages (UCFitness, Portfolio)
- Addition of essential pages (Privacy Policy, Contact)
- Sitemap configuration
