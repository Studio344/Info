# Site Renewal: Enhancing Usability and Technical Content

I have fully renewed my portfolio site to improve user experience and share more detailed technical information. Previously a single-page layout, the site is now multi-page, allowing for dedicated project details and a blog section.

My goal was to move beyond a simple "link collection" and create content where I can explain "what technologies were used" and "key implementation details" for each project.

Key changes include:

- **Project Detail Pages**: Created dedicated pages for projects like UCFitness.
- **Essential Pages**: Added Privacy Policy and Contact pages.
- **Sitemap**: Organized the site structure for better navigation.

I will be updating the development logs irregularly. Thank you for visiting!
