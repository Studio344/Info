# Full Portfolio Site Renewal: From Link Collection to Technical Showcase

## Why the Renewal?

I completely rebuilt the Studio344 portfolio site from scratch. The previous version was a single long-scrolling page that simply listed project links — functional, but far from ideal. It had several critical shortcomings:

- **Thin content**: Only project names and links, with no technical details
- **No publishing platform**: No place to write development logs or technical tips
- **Poor scalability**: Everything crammed into a single HTML file made maintenance difficult
- **Missing essential pages**: No privacy policy, terms of service, or contact page

The goal was to evolve from a "simple link collection" into a "portfolio capable of technical storytelling."

## Technology Choices

### Hosting: GitHub Pages

Since the site runs as a static site, **GitHub Pages** was the natural choice. The simplicity of pushing to a GitHub repository and having it deployed automatically is hard to beat. Custom domain `studio344.net` with free HTTPS is an added bonus.

### Animation: GSAP + ScrollTrigger

To add life to the pages, I chose **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) v3.12.2** combined with the ScrollTrigger plugin. This enables scroll-linked animations like fade-ins and slide transitions.

Why GSAP over CSS animations?
- Complex timeline orchestration that's difficult with CSS alone
- Excellent performance with GPU acceleration
- Rich easing functions for natural-feeling motion

### Internationalization: i18next

For Japanese/English bilingual support, I implemented **i18next v23.2.3**. By using HTML `data-i18n` attributes for declarative translation mapping, the JavaScript code stays cleanly separated from translation data.

### UI Design: Bento Grid + Aurora UI

The design concept uses a **Bento Grid layout** — an Apple-inspired card-based UI that organizes information visually while maintaining a modern aesthetic. The background combines **Aurora UI** elements (gradient orbs, grid overlay, and noise texture) for a sense of depth and sophistication.

## Key Changes

### Multi-Page Architecture

The site was restructured from a single page into purpose-specific pages:

| Page | Content |
|------|---------|
| **index.html** | Landing page (hero + about + navigation) |
| **projects.html** | Project gallery |
| **blog.html** | Development logs & technical articles |
| **about.html** | Bio, skills, and philosophy |
| **contact.html** | Contact information |

### Project Detail Pages

Each project now has a dedicated detail page featuring iframe live previews, technology stack breakdowns, and performance metrics. These pages tell the story of **what** was built, **how** it was built, and **why** specific technical decisions were made.

### Blog System

I built a lightweight Markdown-based blog system using **marked.js** for Markdown-to-HTML conversion and a `list.json` manifest for post management. This flat-file approach means articles live directly in the GitHub repository — no CMS needed, keeping the developer workflow natural and version-controlled.

### Essential Pages

- Privacy Policy with detailed data handling disclosures
- Terms of Service
- Contact page
- XML Sitemap for search engine discovery

## Design Philosophy

### Responsive Design

Using CSS Grid and Flexbox together, the layout adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile. The primary breakpoint is at 600px, with card layouts and font sizes adjusting progressively.

### Performance Optimization

- External libraries loaded via CDN for fast initial rendering
- Minimal image assets; icons unified as SVG
- Animations leverage GPU acceleration for smooth 60fps performance

## Looking Ahead

This renewal is just the beginning. Planned improvements include:

- Regular technical article publishing (targeting 2-3 posts per month)
- Additional project showcases as new applications are developed
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Enhanced page transition animations

By documenting each step of the development process, I'm creating a growth log for myself and hopefully a useful reference for others facing similar challenges. Stay tuned for more updates!
