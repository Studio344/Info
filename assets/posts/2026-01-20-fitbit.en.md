# UCFitness: Battling Fitbit API Rate Limits

The biggest hurdle in developing my custom fitness tracker 'UCFitness' was the Fitbit API Rate Limit. The limit of 150 requests per hour per user was quite strict for an app requiring real-time updates.

To solve this, I adopted an architecture combining Next.js API Routes and Supabase to batch fetch and cache data in the background. This prevents excessive requests from the frontend while providing high-speed ranking displays to users.
