# UCFitness Dev Log: Overcoming Fitbit API Rate Limits

During the development of my custom fitness tracker "UCFitness,"<br>
the biggest challenge was the **Fitbit API Rate Limit**.<br>
The limit of "150 requests per hour per user" is quite strict<br>
for an application that requires real-time data updates.

To solve this, I adopted an architecture combining **Next.js API Routes**<br>
and **Supabase**.<br>
Instead of sending a request for every user interaction,<br>
I implemented a system to fetch data in batches in the background<br>
and cache it in Supabase.

This approach successfully prevented excessive requests from the frontend<br>
while enabling high-speed ranking display.<br>
It was a valuable lesson in overcoming API constraints through architectural design.
