# UCFitness Dev Log: Battling the Fitbit API Rate Limit

When I was building my custom fitness tracker, "UCFitness," the biggest headache was definitely the **Fitbit API Rate Limit**.
They have a limit of "150 requests per hour per user," which is actually pretty strict if you're trying to build an app that updates in real-time.

So, I decided to tackle this by combining **Next.js API Routes** with **Supabase**!
Instead of hitting the API every time a user loads the page, I set up an architecture where data is fetched in batches in the background and cached in Supabase.

Thanks to this approach, I stopped sending excessive requests from the frontend, and the ranking display became super fast! It's amazing what a little architectural tweaking can do.
