# UCFitness Dev Log: Overcoming Fitbit API Rate Limits

During the development of my custom fitness tracker "UCFitness," the biggest challenge was the **Fitbit API Rate Limit**. The limit of "150 requests per hour per user" is quite strict for an application that requires real-time data updates.

To solve this, I adopted an architecture combining **Next.js API Routes** and **Supabase**. Instead of sending a request for every user interaction, I implemented a system to fetch data in batches in the background and cache it in Supabase.

This approach successfully prevented excessive requests from the frontend while enabling high-speed ranking display. It was a valuable lesson in overcoming API constraints through architectural design.
