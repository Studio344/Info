# Static Site Performance Optimization: Lighthouse Score Improvement Strategy

## Introduction

Studio344's portfolio site is optimized with a focus on Google Lighthouse scores. You might think "it's a hobby site, so performance isn't that important," but since it affects AdSense approval and SEO rankings, basic optimization is worth implementing. In this article, I'll share the optimizations I performed and their results.

## Lighthouse's Four Categories

Lighthouse evaluates sites across four categories:

| Category | What It Measures |
|----------|-----------------|
| Performance | Page load speed, time to interactive |
| Accessibility | Screen reader support, contrast ratios, etc. |
| Best Practices | Security, image optimization, console errors |
| SEO | Meta tags, crawlability, mobile-friendliness |

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Asynchronous Script Loading

The most effective optimization was adding `async` / `defer` attributes to external scripts (GSAP, i18next, AdSense).

```html
<!-- AdSense: async loading -->
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<!-- GSAP: loaded at page bottom -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js"></script>

<!-- i18next: loaded at page bottom -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/i18next@23.2.3/i18next.min.js"></script>
```

Loading from CDNs also benefits from HTTP/2 parallel fetching, minimizing performance impact.

### 2. CSS Optimization

I removed unused CSS rules and placed critical styles inline. Animation CSS for `aurora-container` and similar effects was trimmed to only initial-render essentials.

### 3. Image Optimization

Studio344 uses very few images, but the logo (PNG) is compressed to optimal size. WebP format conversion is recommended where possible.

## Accessibility Improvements

### Semantic HTML

Non-accessible elements like `<div onclick>` were replaced with proper `<a>` tags. This supports both keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### Contrast Ratios

Dark-themed sites often have insufficient text contrast. Studio344 uses `#ddd` (87% lightness) or above for body text. Darker grays (`#888`) are reserved for supplementary text only, never for primary content.

### ARIA Labels

Icon-only buttons (hamburger menu, GitHub link) include `aria-label` attributes:

```html
<button class="hamburger" aria-label="Menu" aria-expanded="false">
```

## SEO Optimization

### Complete Meta Tags

Every page has `<meta name="description">` set. Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`) are also placed on main pages to optimize appearance when shared on social media.

### sitemap.xml

All public pages are registered in `sitemap.xml` with priority (`<priority>`) and last modified dates (`<lastmod>`). Orphaned or deprecated pages are promptly removed to provide crawlers with accurate information.

### noscript Fallback

Content dynamically generated by JavaScript (blog article list, project list) includes `<noscript>` tags with static HTML. This ensures content is recognized by crawlers that don't execute JavaScript.

## Best Practices

### HTTPS

GitHub Pages + custom domain automatically enables HTTPS. I verified there's no mixed content (HTTP images or CSS).

### External Link Safety

Links with `target="_blank"` include `rel="noopener"` to mitigate security risks.

## Actual Score Progression

Score changes before and after optimization:

| Category | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Performance | 78 | 92 |
| Accessibility | 85 | 98 |
| Best Practices | 83 | 95 |
| SEO | 72 | 100 |

SEO improved dramatically just from adding meta tags and sitemap.

## Conclusion

Static site performance optimization is about accumulating small improvements. Just covering the basics — asynchronous script loading, semantic HTML, complete meta tags — significantly improves Lighthouse scores. Even for hobby sites, these measures directly impact AdSense approval and user experience, so they're worth reviewing at least once.
